### Hi there üëã

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I'm a passionate Data Scientist and recent graduate from the University of California, Berkeley, with a Master's degree in Data Science and a Bachelor's in Molecular Biology. My academic journey has been a blend of rigorous learning and practical application. I have honed my expertise in Data Engineering, Statistics, Data Visualization, and Machine Learning through both coursework and cutting-edge projects.

üîç Data Analysis & Engineering Expertise:

- My academic journey at UC Berkeley armed me with skills in data engineering, statistics, and visualization, not to mention a firm grounding in machine learning and causal inference.
- Projects like AudioAid have allowed me to explore the power of audio data, achieving impressive model robustness with Convolutional Neural Networks and a 99% F-1 score in fall detection systems.
- I've also demonstrated the capacity of CNNs to classify brain tumors from MRI images with high accuracy, and investigated the effects of various mediums on reading comprehension.

üíª Technical Toolbox:

- Proficient in programming with Python and R, and handling databases with SQL, MySQL, Docker, SQLServer, and PostgreSQL.
- Versed in machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, Pytorch, and Keras, and bringing data to life through visualization with D3.js and Tableau.
- Comfortable in cloud environments such as AWS Cloud and Google Cloud IoT, crafting prototypes with tools like Figma, Canva, and Adobe XD, and I'm well-versed in IoT applications with Raspberry Pi and AWS IoT.
- My version control of choice is Git, facilitated through GitHub for seamless collaboration and code management.
